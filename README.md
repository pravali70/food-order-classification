# 🍽️ Food Order Prediction - Mini Project
👋 Welcome to this exciting machine learning project on Customer Food Ordering Behavior Prediction!

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, we analyze a real-world dataset that captures various demographic and behavioral traits of customers, including:

Gender

Marital Status

Occupation

Income

Education

Family Size

Location (Latitude & Longitude)

User Feedback

The target variable, Output, indicates whether a customer placed a food order or not.

Our goal is to build a full-fledged machine learning pipeline—from data exploration and preprocessing to model building and evaluation—to accurately classify whether a customer is likely to place a food order.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective is to develop and evaluate multiple classification models to predict food ordering behavior (Order or No Order).

This prediction helps food delivery platforms and restaurants to:

Understand customer purchasing behavior

Design targeted marketing campaigns

Improve delivery and operational efficiency

Boost customer retention and engagement

## 🤖 Models Evaluated
We trained and tested the following machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

AdaBoost

XGBoost

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
Each model is assessed using the following metrics:

Accuracy – Overall prediction correctness

Precision – Correctly predicted positive cases (orders)

Recall – Actual orders correctly identified

F1 Score – Balance between precision and recall

Confusion Matrix – Detailed breakdown of true/false positives and negatives

These metrics provide a comprehensive view of how well each model performs, especially when handling imbalanced or behavioral data.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
The project is implemented in Python, leveraging the following libraries:

pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

xgboost – Advanced boosting techniques

tensorflow / keras – For building the ANN model

## ✅ Outcome
By comparing model performance across multiple metrics, we:

Identify the best-performing algorithm for predicting food orders

Derive actionable insights to optimize marketing, customer engagement, and delivery logistics

Enable data-driven decision-making to personalize customer interactions and improve overall business outcomes

💡 Thank you for exploring this project! We hope it helps you understand how machine learning can power smarter food delivery strategies through behavioral prediction.
